Our research focuses on computational mechanics and the efficient numerical solution of partial differential equations. Recent work in this group has focused on accurate high order methods for time-dependent wave propagation and fluid dynamics, as well as their efficient implementation on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). 

You can find a complete list of publications on my [**Google Scholar page**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nA29Z5YAAAAJ&hl=en/), or on arXiv under "Jesse Chan".
