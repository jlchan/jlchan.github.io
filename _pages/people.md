**Bio:** Jesse Chan is an assistant professor in the Department of Computational and Applied Mathematics at Rice University.  He received his PhD in Computational and Applied Mathematics from the University of Texas at Austin in 2013 working on high order adaptive finite element methods for steady compressible fluid flows.  He served as a Pfieffer postdoctoral instructor at Rice University from 2013-2015, and as a postdoctoral researcher at Virginia Tech from 2015-2016 before returning to Rice as faculty in 2016. His research focuses on accurate and efficient numerical solutions of time-dependent partial differential equations. His recent work has focused on the construction of provably stable high order methods for wave propagation and fluid dynamics and their implementation on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).
