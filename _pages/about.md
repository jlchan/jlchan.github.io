Our group focuses on computational mechanics and the efficient numerical solution of time-dependent partial differential equations. Recent work in this group has focused on provably stable and high order accurate methods for time-dependent wave propagation and fluid dynamics, as well as their efficient implementation on modern many-core architectures. 

We gratefully acknowledge the support of the NSF (DMS-CAREER-1943186 and DMS-2231482) in making this work possible.

By factoring material coefficients into the mass matrix, we simplify the formulation of stable DG methods for both isotropic and anisotropic media.
