We have an open position for a [**CAAM Pfieffer Postdoctoral Instructor**](https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs/jobs/12232) (application through mathjobs.org). Please feel free to contact me for more information.

## Research: 

Our research focuses on computational mechanics and the efficient numerical solution of partial differential equations. Recent work in this group has focused on accurate high order methods for time-dependent wave propagation and fluid dynamics, as well as their efficient implementation on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). 

## News:

* August 2018: Kaihang Guo successfully defends his MA thesis on low-complexity GPU-accelerated DG methods for wave propagation in media with sub-cell heterogeneities. 
* June 2018: our paper on [discretely entropy stable DG methods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999118301153) is now online. We show how to generalize the construction of discretely entropy stable methods to ``modal'' DG formulations. The resulting formulations extend semi-discrete entropy stability theory to arbitrary bases and standard finite element quadrature rules.
* May 2018: our paper on [explicit time-stepping isogeometric methods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045782518300240) is now online. In this paper, we show how to efficiently combine isogeometric finite elements with explicit time-stepping while avoiding the inversion of a dense mass matrix. These methods have the advantage of a better CFL constant at high orders of approximation.
* Jan 2018: Kaihang Guo receives the [K2i fellowship](https://caamweb.rice.edu/news/k2i-fellowships-2017).
